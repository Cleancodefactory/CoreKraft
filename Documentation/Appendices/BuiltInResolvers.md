# Built-in parameter resolvers

In the NodeSet files (Definition.json in a sub-directory of NodeSets module directory) one can specify parameters at each `node` or even separate set of parameters for read and write operations done by the node. Additionally parameters can be specified at root level of the NodeSet and they will be applicable in any node in the NodeSet at any depth. For more information see the CoreKraft documentation and tutorials.

Here we describe the built-in `resolvers` that can be used in the parameter expressions. The parameters are specified as follows (regardless of where in the NodeSet it is placed):

```JSON
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "param1",
            "Expression": "GetFrom('client', name)"
        },
        {
            "name": "param2",
            "Expression": "GetFrom('current,parent', 'id')"
        }
        // And more entries like these
    ]
```

The `Expression` entry specifies how to obtain and calculate the value for the parameter. Check the rest of the documentation for more information how they are consumed by various plugins. To keep this document readable on its own, lets illustrate it in an SQL query possibly executed by one of the database plugins:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE ID=@id AND SOME_FIELD LIKE '%' || @param1 || '%';
```

## The language of the `Expression`

The `resolver expressions` are a very simplistic miniature language with a extremely small set of basic rules and support for functions we call `Resolvers`. The resolvers that can be used are configurable and their numbers can be extended with plugins containing more of them. These extended sets of resolvers may be available in one project and not available in another. In this document we list those that are built-in inside the CoreKraft itself and are always there - can be used in any expression in any CoreKraft project.

## The expression syntax

The extended Backusâ€“Naur form of the syntax is:

```EBNF

Expr = "name" | Resolver | Number | String | Boolean | "null" | Parameter ;

Resolver = Identifier "(" (  [ Expr { "," Expr } ] ")" ;

Number = [ "-" | "+" ] { Digit } [ "." { Digit } ] ;

Digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

Letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
       | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
       | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
       | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b"
       | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
       | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
       | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w"
       | "x" | "y" | "z" ;

String = "'" [ { Character } ] "'" ;

Boolean = "false" | "true" ;

Parameter = IdentifierString ;

Identifier = IdentifierString ;

IdentifierString = ( Letter | "_" ) [ { Letter | "_" | Digit | "." } ] ;

```

This basically boils down to a syntax consisting of function calls with parameters which can in turn be function calls. The functions are the `resolvers` we describe below and there are some possible literals, namely `numbers`, `strings` and `booleans`, some special keywords like `name` and `null` and the `Parameter` keywords. The `resolvers` have exact number of arguments and variable number of arguments is not currently supported by the resolver expression engine.

`name` - Acts as a string that is exactly the name of the parameter. In the example above `name` will resolve to "param1" in the first expression.

`null` - Denotes a null value literal.

`Parameter` - This is the name of another parameter from the list of the configured parameters. So, the expression defining one parameter can use the other parameters - their expressions by simply placing the name of the parameter. An example:

```JSON
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "param1",
            "Expression": "GetFrom('client', name)"
        },
        {
            "name": "param2",
            "Expression": "Concat(param1,'%')"
        }
    ]
```

In this example param2 is param1 concatenated with "%" character which could be useful in LIKE conditions in SQL for example.

In current CoreKraft versions the recursion level allowed for using the `Parameter` syntax is **limited to only one level**. This means that if in the example above a param3 tries to use param2 in a similar way, this will violate the limitation and will cause an exception. This limitation is imposed for a reason, its purpose is to prevent the temptation to use the parameter expressions as a programming language. They are pre-compiled and fast enough for what they do, but making too complex expressions and causing recursion can lead to uncontrollable and hard to calculate complexity. One should not forget that they are intended mainly as the means to fetch the data needed by the plugins, best example are the DB plugins.

Where the initial data comes from? Notice the `GetFrom` resolver, it fetches a value from the context collections which represent the data in the current request (be it an HTTP one or not.). In the end of the document there is more detailed description of the available collections and what they correspond to.

## The built in resolvers

### GetFrom(sources, paramname)

**sources** - A string specifying comma separated list of sources to check.

**paramname** - The name to look for.

Gets a value from the standard sources. When a list of sources is specified, checks them in the order specified until a parameter with the paramname is found or returns null if the list is exhausted.

The type of the returned value will depend on the source's capability to return differently typed values. Depending on the plugins that use the parameters it might be possible to leave the potentially needed conversion to them or write more precise expressions that make sure the values are presented to the plugins already converted. See for example the `CastAs` resolver below.

Standard sources:

`current` - (write). Represents the object processed by the node. 

`input` - (write). Alias for current.

`filter` - (read). Represents the JSON posted to CoreKraft. When this is an http request this will be JSON body of a POST request (these are the typical requests sent by BindKraft apps).

`data` - (read and write). The same as filter, but available in both read and write operations.

`parent` - (read and write). Represents the object processed by the parent node of the current node. Typical usages of this would be when one creates a child node that extracts data related to the data processed/fetched by the parent node. In case of databases this is often the primary key field of the "parent" record.

`parents` - (read and write). Like parent, but represents the combined result of all the parents down the NodeSet tree. This source gets used not so often, because it makes sense only in NodeSets with depth of at least 3 which are rarely an everyday matter.

`client` - (read and write). In HTTP requests this represents the query string. In other requests it depends on the implementation, but it is always something that plays a similar role.

`server` - (read and write). A number of server defined variables.

_**Currently**_ there is no separate source for a typical form post x-www-form-urlencoded, nor for multipart/form-data, because they are internally represented as a posted JSON which can be addressed with the existing sources. This means that the CoreKraft abstracts all the post and post-like requests containing named values the same way.

_**Currently**_ there is no representation of headers of HTTP requests and according to the CoreKraft's concept there should never be one. If headers or any header-like data has to reach the NodeSet the `processor` that accepts the request must copy it into one or more of the other collections. However, we noticed the need for another abstract source that represents data considered as metadata/OOB data or something similar and this can be introduced in near future.

_**Currently**_ multiple values attached to the same name are not supported for HTTP requests and if support is introduced it will take the form of an array (as if a value in JSON post is an array). Processing arrays is supported by some resolvers, but is hard to provide full general support without introducing disproportionally complex additions and we are working on finding the right way to do this without making writing CoreKraft NodeSets harder.


### GetUserId()

If there is a logged on user, returns the user id provided by the authorization server (see authentication and authorization in CoreKraft). If there is no logged on user the resolver returns null.

### GetUserEmail()

If there is a logged on user, returns the email provided by the authorization server, otherwise returns null.

### HasRoleName(role)

Returns a 0 | 1 result indicating if the logged on user has the `role`.

**role** - a string specifying the role name. These are the roles given by the authorization server, any application specific roles are its own concern.

### Or(a,b)

Returns 0 | 1 result indicating if the any one of the two arguments is true like.

**a**, **b** - Arguments to check.
### Concat(a, b)

Converts the two arguments to string (if they are not strings already) and returns a string of them both concatenated one after the other.

**a**, **b** - The arguments to concatenate.

### Replace(a, b, c)

Returns a string `a` with all occurrences of `b` replaced with `c`.

The arguments `a` and `b` are not converted to string - they have to be strings. The argument **c** is converted to string.

_This behavior is chosen because when replacing substrings the conversion of the base string and substring being searched often requires specific conversion._

### Coalesce(a, b)

Returns the first argument if it is not null, otherwise returns the second argument.

### NumAsText(a)

If the argument is numeric returns it as `content string`, in all other cases it returns the `content string` "**null**".

### CastAs(a, b)

Casts `b` to the type specified by `a`

**a** - a string specifying the type to which to convert the second argument. The supported type names are "`int`", "`uint`", "`double`" and "`string`".

**b** - the argument to convert.

### Add(a, b)

### Sub(a, b)

### AsContent(a)

### OrderByEntry(a, b, c)

### OrderBy(a)

### ApiTokenFromAuth(a)

### GetUserDetails(a)

### GetUserRoles()

### Skip()

### IntegerContent(a)

### idlist(a,b)

### IfThenElse(condition, pos, neg)

**condition** - null or a numeric value. If it is true like hte resolver returns pos, otherwise neg.

**pos**, **neg** - The two possible returnees, they will be returned "as is" without type or flags changed.
