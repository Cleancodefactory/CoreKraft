# CoreKraft

We are reconstructing CoreKraft documentation. This will be the main entry point. We will add sections as they are written or revised.


## Resolver expressions

[Built in resolvers](Appendices/BuiltInResolvers.md) - The built-in resolver functions that can always be used in the `Expression` property of any `parameters` section in nodeset's `Definition.json` files

## Action Query in CoreKraft

[Action Query](ActionQuery/ActionQuery.md) - integrated algorithmic language in CoreKraft that can be used to build small plugins on the fly without creating whole new .NET projects for each one of them.
