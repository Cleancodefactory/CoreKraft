# ActionQuery (AQ) in CoreKraft

CoreKraft includes support for very simple scripting handled by plugins. It is based on [ActionQuery](https://github.com/Cleancodefactory/ActionQuery) library and is available for NodeSet plugins implemented for specific projects as well.

The support for AQ is in the form of a host class any plugin can create and execute scripts against it. Additionally there are default libraries of functions and additional libraries (files and images functions for example) which can be included in the host and made available to the scrips when necessary.  See details on how to use it later in this document.

Ready-to-use `Scripter` nodeset plugin is provided for use whenever AQ scripting is enough (i.e. there is no need of a custom plugin to provide additional features). See [Scripter plugin](ScripterPlugin.md) for how-to instructions.
